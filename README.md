The **Unitary Compiler Collection (UCC)** is a Python library for frontend-agnostic, high performance compilation of quantum circuits. 

UCC interfaces automatically with multiple quantum computing frameworks, including [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit), [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq), and [PyTKET](https://github.com/CQCL/tket) and supports programs in OpenQASM 2 and [OpenQASM 3](https://openqasm.com/). For a full list of the latest supported interfaces, just call `ucc.supported_formats`.


**Want to know more?** 
- Check out our [documentation](https://ucc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which you can build locally after installation by running `make html` in `ucc/docs/source`.
- For code, repo, or theory questions, especially those requiring more detailed responses, submit a [Discussion](https://github.com/unitaryfund/ucc/discussions).
- For casual or time sensitive questions, chat with us on [Discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation).

## Quickstart

### Installation

**Note**: UCC requires Python version >= 3.12.

```bash
pip install ucc
```

or install a dev version!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/unitaryfund/ucc.git
cd ucc
pip install -e . # Editable mode
```

### Example with Qiskit, Cirq, and PyTKET

Define a circuit with your preferred quantum SDK and compile it!

```python
from ucc import compile

from pytket import Circuit as TketCircuit
from cirq import Circuit as CirqCircuit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit as QiskitCircuit
from cirq import H, CNOT, LineQubit

def test_tket_compile():
    circuit = TketCircuit(2)
    circuit.H(0)
    circuit.CX(0, 1)
    compile(circuit)

def test_qiskit_compile():
    circuit = QiskitCircuit(2)
    circuit.h(0)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    compile(circuit)

def test_cirq_compile():
    qubits = LineQubit.range(2)
    circuit = CirqCircuit(
        H(qubits[0]), 
        CNOT(qubits[0], qubits[1]))
    compile(circuit)
```

## How does UCC stack up?

We run benchmarks regularly to compare against the most recent versions of the most popular quantum compiler frameworks for a range of circuits. Here's the latest:
![alt text](benchmarks/latest_compiler_benchmarks_by_circuit.png)

In addition to raw compilation stats, we simulate the compiled circuits with a noisy density matrix simulation to see how each compiler impacts performance:

![Violin plot showing absolute error of each compiler across a variety of circuits](benchmarks/latest_expval_benchmark_by_compiler.png)

And here you can see progress over time (changes usually indicate a newer version came out):
![alt text](benchmarks/avg_compiler_benchmarks_over_time.png)
Note that the compile times before 2024-12-10 may have been run on different classical compute instances, so their exact runtime is not reported here, but you can find this data in benchmarks/results.
After 2024-12-10, all data present in this plot is on the same compute instance using our [ucc-benchmarks](https://github.com/unitaryfund/ucc/blob/main/.github/workflows/ucc-benchmarks.yml) GitHub Actions workflow.

## Benchmarking

You can benchmark the performance of ucc against other compilers using `./ucc/benchmarks/scripts/run_benchmarks.sh`. This script runs compiler benchmarks in parallel, so you will need to first install `parallel` to support it.    

On Mac you can do this with `brew install parallel`.
